# How To Request Your Own USRBG Banner

1. **Join the Black Box Discord Server**: Click [here](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb) to join. Once there, navigate to the [#click-here-to-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/) channel.

2. **Upload Your Banner**: Ensure your banner is in one of the supported file types: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif. The maximum file size is 10 MB. Note that links to banners are not accepted; you must download and then upload the banner. Also, adult or NSFW banners are against the USRBG ToS and will be rejected.

3. **Wait for Approval**: Your background request will be reviewed and approved. This process may take some time.

4. **Check Your Banner**: 
    - If your banner request is approved but not visible, restart Vencord.
    - If it still doesnâ€™t appear, wait a bit longer as updates may take some time to process.
    - Restart Vencord again if necessary.
    - Ensure that the USRBG plugin is enabled if you still can't see your banner.
