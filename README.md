# How To Request Your Own USRBG Banner

1. Join [Black Box Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb) and go to [#click-here-to-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/)

2. Upload your banner (supported file types: .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .gif), Max size is 10 MB. Links won't work, download it and upload. Adult / NSFW banner is against the USRBG ToS and it will be rejected.

3. Wait for your background request to be approved, take a bit of time.

4. If your banner request is approved but you don't see it, restart Vencord. If still not, wait a bit more (it takes sometimes to update) and restart Vencord again. If you still can't see it, make you sure enable USRBG plugin.
