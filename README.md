Hello Vencord user owo

# How to request your own USRBG banner

1. Join [Black Box Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb) and go to [#background-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/)

2. Click **upload** button and upload your image from your device, **Only .GIF .PNG .JPG .JPEG will be accepted.**
<br>**DO NOT REQUEST Adult/NSFW content for your banners, this is against USRBG Terms of Service and will be rejected.**

3. Wait for your background request to be approved, take a bit of time.

4. If your background request is approved but you don't see it, restart Vencord. If still not, wait a bit more (it takes sometimes to update) and restart Vencord again.
